# Speaker-independent Speech Separation with Deep Attractor Network

## Summary

## KeyWords

    PIT - Permutation Invariant Training

## Abstract

    Primary Problems in single microphone speech recognition -
    
    1) Arbitary order of speakers (Permutation Problem)
    2) Unkown number of speakers (Output Dimension Problem)
    
    Their approach is to find an embedding space in which the speaker's voice embeddings are close.
    More information would be given in the paper
    
## Introduction

    What is complex Gaussian?
    What is independent component analysis (ICA)?
    What is computational auditory scene analysis (CASA)?
    What is Spectral Clustering?
    
    They have talked clearly about the Permutation Problem and Output Dimentionality Problem
    
    Deep Clustering (DPCL) - 
    
    Trained to have the feature embeddings close for same speakers and far away for different speakers
    
    What is Frobenius norm?
    What is affinity matrix?
    Affinity matrix is permutation invariant
