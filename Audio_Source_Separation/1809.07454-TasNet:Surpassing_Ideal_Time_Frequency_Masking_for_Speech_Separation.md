## ABSTRACT - 

    Same as 1711.00541 - TASNET: TIME-DOMAIN AUDIO SEPARATION NETWORK FOR REAL-TIME, SINGLE-CHANNEL SPEECH SEPARATION
    
## INTRODUCTION - 

    Same three problems as described in 1711.00541
    
    Contradicts its previous paper which claimed it can be run on low-powered devices as it only compared on the window
    for latency. They didn't compare the LSTM parameters.
    
    What is Depthwise CNN?
    
    They are proposing to completely eliminate the LSTM model and use just CNN instead of it.
    (CNN still has lot of computations involved but this can be run in parallel unlike LSTM, the model size might be smaller)
    
## RELATED WORK

    People have tried to replace the STFT and ISTFT using autoencoders, U-Net
    
## CONVOLUTIONAL TIME-DOMAIN AUDIO SEPARATION NETWORK

    Temporal Convolutional Network is nothing but stacked convolutions with dilation which keeps increasing. The input
