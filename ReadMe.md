# Untangling the Universe

## Summary

    This repositories contributions are two-fold

    1 We have a unified place for every research paper related to the topic we are currrently tracking
    2 We have an untangled summary of the entire paper making it faster and easier to understand

## Abstract

    Starting my journey of reading research papers around 3 years ago, I have felt myself quite a number of times being lost through the wilderness of a research paper only to realise later that the idea itself was simple while the literature made it complicated.
    Also looking back to the papers I read 3 years ago, I can't remember the finer details of the paper which actually matters a lot.
    This repository is a means to bridge the gap and create a life-long digital summary to keep the memory ever-green.

## INTRODUCTION

    This Repository is currently tracking 
    
    1 Text Detection and Recognition
    2 Audio separation using visual features
    
## Experiments

    We are still experimenting with the format of how to make the summary so that it is very structured and yet generic.
    Some of the features that remain to be added - 
    
    - [ ] General Structure for the summary which is applicable to all deep learning papers
    - [ ] Linking already existing in-summary lines in different papers    

## Conclusion

    We hope to provide a platform where everyone, from a researcher, who has been in the field for 60 years, to an engineer, who has just started, have clear understanding of the topics they are interested in.
    We actively need contributors to make this a success. If you read a research paper and want to keep in your heart forever, do create a summary and create a pull request.
