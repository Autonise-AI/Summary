# PixelLink: Detecting Scene Text via Instance Segmentation

## Summary

    This repositories contributions are two-fold

    1 We have a unified place for every research paper related to the topic we are currrently tracking
    2 We have an untangled summary of the entire paper making it faster and easier to understand

## Abstract

    Semantic Segmentation over Bounding Box Regression
    Instance Segmentation for close text bbox
    Advantages - Requires less data, fewer training iterations, better results
    
## INTRODUCTION

    General models predict two things
    
    1 Bounding box co-ordinates using regression
    2 Probability of that bounding box being text or non-text

    Location regression is not the only way to find Bounding Box we can use segmentation
    
    Pixel Link predicts links for each pixel to its 8 adjacent pixels and is able to do instance segmentation by 
    building a graph of these links and finding connected components.

## Related Work

### Semantic&Instance Segmentation

    Discusses some of the recent advances in semantic and instance segmentation like Mask R-CNN, Faster R-CNN   
## Experiments

    We are still experimenting with the format of how to make the summary so that it is very structured and yet generic.
    Some of the features that remain to be added - 
    
    - [ ] General Structure for the summary which is applicable to all deep learning papers
    - [ ] Linking already existing in-summary lines in different papers

## Conclusion

    We hope to provide a platform where everyone, from a researcher, who has been in the field for 60 years, to an engineer, who has just started, have clear understanding of the topics they are interested in.
    We actively need contributors to make this a success. If you read a research paper and want to keep in your heart forever, do create a summary and create a pull request.
